# test_automation_project
It's my project with autotests. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my skills to create autotests in Python, my knowledge of Selenium Webdriver, Python, PyTest framework and Page Object pattern.
The tests are written to check how the functionality of the "Oscar Sandbox" online store (http://selenium1py.pythonanywhere.com/en-gb/) works. 
The project includes autotests with parameterization (tests are available for different languages and for two browsers Chrome and Firefox, test_guest_can_add_product_to_basket is available for ten different URL).
All tests work. Test that fail are marked with @pytest.mark.xfail.
